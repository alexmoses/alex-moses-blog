Hi!

My name is Alex. In the workplace, I enjoy demystifying data to solve problems. I think food is the true meaning to life, so when I'm not working you will most likely find me searching for my next favorite restaurant or takeaway spot! My other hobbies include photography, golf and web development.

I believe that mutual collaboration is what moves us forward and brings us closer together. I created this blog to inspire, teach, learn and keep me motivated as I go forward in my life's journey.
