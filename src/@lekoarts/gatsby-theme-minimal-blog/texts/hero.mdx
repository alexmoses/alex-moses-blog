# Hi.
my name is Alex. In the workplace, I enjoy demystifying data to solve problems. I think food is the true meaning to life, so when I'm not working you will most likely find me searching for my next favorite restaurant or takeaway spot! My other hobbies include photography, golf and table tennis. I recently created a new platform to generate new leads and enrich stakeholder insights with behaviourial data. Mutual collaboration is what brings us closer together and so I created this blog to inspire, teach, learn and show as I go forward in my life's journey.
